<h1>CPU Education</h1>
<body>
    <p>The CPU is considered to be the brains of a computer. Without it, the computer is unable to process and perform any tasks. When learning about computer architecture, the CPU plays an important part because it get instructions from memory, decodes it into binary, executes it, and stores the output to memory. The lesson plan is aimed towards educational providers who want to implement a beginner course on CPU development and for self-learners. It is assumed that they have basic coding skills and have <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html">Vivado</a>, a software suite to access and experiment with our CPU design.</p>

    <p>A breakdown of each CPU component is shown below. Each module explains what its functionalities are and 
    and how it interacts with other components. There are also short examples and quiz questions before moving onto the next module. These modules should be used alongside <a href="http://github.com/heimskr/educpu">this Vivado project</a>, 
    a simple CPU designed for others with very little knowledge on CPU design and computer architecture.
    Learners should be able to understand each component and implement the given examples. In addition, the documentation and examples should allow them to explore and modify the simple CPU code on their own.</p>
